/**
 * How long to wait before offering the credentials again to a phone that keeps refusing them.
 *
 * A phone that answers every message and then reports it could not join is invisible to the
 * handshake backoff, which only counts handshakes the phone was silent through. Measured on a
 * K706 with the phone's own hotspot up: ten full credential handoffs in 61.5 s, 6.83 s apart,
 * each one a "Connecting to Android Auto" flicker on the phone.
 *
 * Widening rather than stopping, because the cause is usually outside the app: the user turning
 * their hotspot off has to be enough to recover, with nothing else to press.
