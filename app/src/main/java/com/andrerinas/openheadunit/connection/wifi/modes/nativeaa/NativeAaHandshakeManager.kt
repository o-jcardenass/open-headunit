     *
     * The loop already refuses to poke once a session exists, but it only asks at the top of each
     * iteration and an iteration is a 15 s hold plus a 15 s gap. A reporter's capture has it
     * exiting 4.1 s after the SSL handshake and 30 s is the worst case, all of it spent opening
     * RFCOMM connections into a link that is already carrying Android Auto. Each one raises an
     * OS-level ACL_CONNECTED that AutoStartReceiver reads as the user's phone arriving.
     *
     * Cheap and idempotent: safe to call on every connect, whatever the transport.
