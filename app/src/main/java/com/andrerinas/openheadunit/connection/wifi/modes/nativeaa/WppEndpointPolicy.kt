 * qualifies once this unit has shown, across two bring-ups, that its kept name comes back with the
 * same address (GroupIdentityStabilityPolicy); until then, and on a unit that re-addresses every
 * time, nothing is advertised. The access point is measured the same way, and its address too,
 * which tethering re-randomises per boot, and a group's IP (SoftApEndpointStabilityPolicy).
 *
 * Withholding is not a cure, only a way of not causing it. An endpoint the phone was given earlier
 * survives for the life of its Android Auto process and is dialled in preference to Bluetooth, so
